# turbo-dollop
We aim to show how the income or urbanization of a state correlates to the density of certain restuarants/stores in that state. For example, we predict that poorer states may have more McDonald's per capita than richer states do per capita. Similarily, richer states will likely have more Whole Foods, or other high end supermarkets, than poor states.

Income, population, and urbanization data can be easily obtained from government sources (like the Census). Companies publish data about store location, so that should not be too hard to find.

We envision plotting all of this on a scatter plot with 50 points (one for each state). The y axis will be # of stores per population and it can be toggled between each store. The x axis can be toggled between median income and urbanization.
